		<h2>Personal Interest Content</h2>
		<h3>Dominic</h3>
		<p>That is my name and it is the best name in existence. My life revolves around
		my wonderful name. If I were to have been named something bad like Jilly or 
		Philly or Suav people would not treat me with respect. My entire livelyhood
		is the way it is because of my name. </p>
		<p>PS. Fun Fact: I have changed my name 3 times in my life. </p>
		<p>PS. Fun Fact: My birth given name was Joseph. </p>
		<p>PS. Fun Fact: Those are lies and you fell for them! </p>
		
		<h3> Music and such </h3>

		<p><img src = "images/otamatone.jpg" width = "180" height = "180"/></p>
		<p> I play many instruments. I own a lot. My sister gets annoyed very quickly when
		I play them. She always gets mad when I get a new one. But that's irrelevant.</p>
		<h4> Drums </h4>
		<p> I have been playing drums for 8 years (since 7 I think I did my math right). 
		I've been in two bands and in both I've played drums. I guess I'm in a third
		but that one doesn't count as much. That one I play a bunch of different instruments
		but that doesn't matter now. I'm pretty good if I may say so myself.</p>
		<h4> Ukulele </h4>
		<p>I play that as well. I'm not amazing but I can get along. Been playing for a couple
		of years </p>
		<h4> Bass </h4>
		<p> I'm fine at bass. I can play. I'm not anything to brag about on the bass though. 
		(That's a saying right?) </p>
		<h4> Banjo </h4>
		<p> Not great. But I definitely can play a good amount of songs on the banjo. </p>
		<h4> Ton of other percussion instruments, including but not limited to </h4>
		<h4> Cajon </h4>
		<h4> Slap-top Cajon </h4>
		<h4> Bongos </h4>
		<h4> Bongo Cajon </h4>
		<h4> Steel Tongue Drum </h4>
		<h4> Hang Gudu </h4>
		<h4> Melodica </h4> 
			<h6> Okay... Melodica isn't percussion, but that doesn't matter. I wanted to list it. </h6>
		<h4> Otamatone </h4>
		<p> That's a lot I know. My family is not a family of billionaires (or even millionares). I mostly get those as gifts 
		an co-buy them with my brother. </p>

	<h2> Milton's </h2>
		<p>Best restaurant in the world. Amazing. If anyone tells you it's bad they
		are either a liar or thinking of the wrong restaurant.</p>
		<p> <img src = "images/miltons.png"/> </p>
	<h2> Burgers </h2>
		<p> I mean really... Why aren't they everyone's favorite food? It tastes
			so much better than other foods. People who like salads and other
			healthy stuff are liars just like the people who don't like Milton's.</p>
			<p> <img src = "images/burgernfries.jpg" width = "400"/> </p>
	<h2> Golf </h2>
		<p> I like playing golf, except when I'm playing poorly. Then I hate it.
		But most of the time I'm amazing and I like playing it. If someone says
		it's not a sport show 'em your ripped biceps. Then they'll change their
		mind.</p>
