			<h1>Unit 1</h2> 
			<p><img src = "images/unit1.jpg"/>  <img src = "images/unit1pic2.jpg"/> </p>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>In unit 1 we started using Jeroo and learned all the basics. 
			We learned how to make Jeroo's and make them walk around and plant things for us.
			The Jeroo had to do a specific task like make a box of flowers. It was very straight
			forward and we approached it with a cut and paste attitude.</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I learned instantiation, basically just how I wanted my
					Jeroo to start.</li>
					<li>I learned basic commands like, hop, plant and toss. </li>
					<li>I learned what flowers and nets and water do to my Jeroo. </li>
					<li>I learned how to upload downloaded things onto Jeroo. </li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				
			<h1>Unit 2</h2> 
			<p><img src = "images/unit2.jpg"/>  <img src = "images/unit2pic2.jpg"/> </p>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>In unit 2 we had labs that made us really think about what we were asking the Jeroo. 
			Most of the labs would have taken forever if we went step by step and not with making methods.
			The Jeroo's had to do more complicated things like plant numbers then reset or other complex
			stuff. We could not just cut and paste.</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I learned how to make methods.</li>
					<li>I learned how to call my own methods.</li>
					<li>We called methods within each other to lessen workload.</li>
					<li>How to stop copy and pasting all the time.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			
			<h1>Unit 3</h2> 
			<p><img src = "images/unit3.jpg"/>  <img src = "images/unit3pic2.jpg"/> </p>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>In unit 3 things got really complicated. Jeroo's had to span the
			whole screen and pick up certain things while avoiving others.
			This unit had much more problem solving and planning involved than
			the other, where if we wrote the code it told us to it would work.
			Many Jeroo's were used to solve problems in one lab. We could name 
			them whatever we wanted.</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I learned while loops. (Let something happen over and over
					until we needed it to stop)</li>
					<li>I learned if statements, that only did the command if something
					else was true (!or false). </li>
					<li> We realized the difference between while and if statements.</li>
					<li>I learned how to end the code (keep it from going forever)
					after what I wanted had finished.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			
			<h1>Unit 4</h2> 
			<p><img src = "images/unit4.jpg"/>  <img src = "images/unit4pic2.jpg"/> </p>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Unit 4 was pretty short. We had even harder problems. We had
			to do multiple things within one method. We had to apply all
			of the knowledge we had learned above. There were some new topics
			but they were just adding more onto what we already knew (example:
			elses were added to if statements) </p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I learned elses within ifs and how to use them.</li>
					<li>We were taught how to work recursively with Jeroo.</li>
					<li>More problem solving.</li>
				</ul>
