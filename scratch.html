		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
			<p><img src = "images/nameAssignment.jpg"/> </P>
		<h2> Description </h2>
			<p> Use Scratch to display your name in an interesting way.
			All of the letters had to have an interesting behavior. 
			Each letter had to be a specific sprite. 
			For extra credit we could make everything reset when the green 
			flag was clicked.</p>
		<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
			<p> <ul> 
<li>  I used event blocks like when green flag clicked or when a key is 
pressed to learn how to trigger an event. </li>
<li> I created my own sprites for my letters.</li>
<li> I used if statements to decide if something was happening.</li>
<li> I used the motion blocks to move the sprites and make them spin. </li>
<li> I used looks to change the color of some sprites. </li>
			</ul> </P> 

</ul></p>
			<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
				<p><img src = "images/computerBuying.jpg"/> </P>
			<h2> Description </h2>
				<p>Create a Scratch presentation that compares and contrasts 
				different types of computers. We had to interview a person’s 
				needs for a computer. We found 4 different options for our 
				interviewee. Then we chose a final computer to give to the person. 
				And we needed to make it interesting to watch. </p>
			<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
				<p> <ul> 
<li> I learned the differences between different computers. </li>
<li> I learned that maybe Mac isn’t always best. .</li>
<li> I take that back Apple prevails all! </li>
<li> I learned how to present something on Scratch.  </li>
<li> I learned what makes computers more expensive.  </li>
			</ul> </P> 

				<h1> Name Assignment </h2>
					<p><img src = "images/finalProj.jpg"/> </p>
				<h2> Description </h2>
					<p>In our Final Project we got to chose between a story 
					and a game. I chose a game. I had to make the project get 
					harder as it progressed. The project had to reset whenever 
					the flag was clicked and it had to say if you won or not.</p>
				<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
					<p> <ul> 
<li> I learned how to make variables in Scratch. </li>
<li> I learned how to use broadcasts.</li>
<li> I learned how to make sprites move on command.</li>
<li> I learned how to make a timer. </li>
<li> I learned sensing, if touching something or a color. </li>
<li> Also, hide and show blocks in looks.</li>
			</ul> </P>
